Crumbl Cookies,What to do about Crumbl Cookies in the office?,"I'm a 51 year old optometrist. My job is pretty sedentary. Frequently reps, patients, and other doctors drop off treats. Rarely is it healthy - although one rep did drop off grapes last week. 

An ophthalmologist sent over about 10 pounds of Crumbl cookies. That is 2 boxes of 6 GIANT cookies each. In addition to the approximately 18 grocery store brand cookies that are also in the breakroom. 

A month ago, I would have eaten three of of these giant cookies for lunch, then certainly felt sick. Now that I am tracking calories I see that each is around 700 calories. No wonder I was overweight. (I've lost about 11 pounds so far with a zillion to go). 

I don't especially like sweets (I am a crunchy, salty guy), but they are hard to resist. Because they are there and they are free. I hate for food to go to waste. 

How do you manage to avoid free office sweets like this????? Any hints? Do you eat like a dice-sized bite and hope that it tides you over? Avoid them entirely. Eat alternative snacks? 

BTW, I am both hungry and bored. Pretty band combination.

Crumbl Cookies,Why Crumbl likely won't exist in 10 years.,"Before I start off. I like the cookies. I'm pro crumbl cookies (most weeks) but I just don't think this brand will survive. 

Initially when Crumbl started the hype was amazing. They lived up to the expectations. However that had fizzled. The cookies all seem to taste the same. Sure there's some one off good ones that pass through but for the most part the same. It's no longer appealing to get my weekly sugar fix there. Some cookies are overly sweet as well. 

Pricing. See above. When an item is new and is hyped. Pricing is often ignored. However this is no longer the case. Paying $4 per cookie might be okay for now but if they try to raise prices it's a death wish for them.

Sales seem to be dipping in several spots. They overextended and saturated themselves in the process. Speaking to a manager at my local crumbl. They used to do so much business on Friday and Saturday that they'd recoup any losses from other days. Now. Those weekends have been slow. I'm not talking about it being winter I mean super slow compared to last year. Maybe it's just my area? I don't know.

I hope I am wrong. I'd very much like this brand to succeed but the food business mixed with overexpansion and high prices is a recipe for disaster. I think most Crumbls will be gone in 10 years.

Crumbl Cookies,I told my 6yo that Crumbl cookies are only for adults,"First: I like Crumbl  cookies. I know there are a lot of people that don’t.

Crumbl Cookies are expensive and a luxury for myself any my husband. We are very discerning about which ones we get because some aren’t for us. We’ve told my daughter, that, like alcohol, only adults can have them. She’d be just as happy if I made some choc chip or bought her a pack of Oreos, and I usually get one of the bakery packs from Walmart for her and her neighborhood friends to enjoy. 

Was watching some true crime and saw a psychologist talking about parents using food control as a way to control their kids and now I feel guilty. Thoughts?

ETA: we generally save them for our quiet tv time after she goes to bed, but we keep them in the fridge so she does see them and ask. We’re not just snacking in front of her and denying her.

Also ETA: homies I keep the cookies in the fridge! My child has open access to said fridge, so I’m not sure how I would hide them. We eat them in pieces so we have to keep the in there so they don’t go bad.

Last ETA, I promise: I really appreciate y’alls perspective! I hadn’t thought about this from a dishonesty standpoint,  and I think we’re gonna have to have a family cookie party starting with an apology. We try to lead by example and should model honesty and ownership of our bad behavior.      … I might still hide the cookies in the future though 😂",90,262,1753118642.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1m5p35r/i_told_my_6yo_that_crumbl_cookies_are_only_for/,"I told my 6yo that Crumbl cookies are only for adults First: I like Crumbl  cookies.

Crumbl Cookies,AITA for not giving my little cousin my Crumbl Cookie?,"This is going to sound dumb but I (16F) have been craving crumbl cookie all week and they had my favorite flavor on the menu (pink sugar cookie). I drove to crumbl and got a single cookie for myself. When I came home from crumbl. I ate half of the cookie and left the other half on the counter. The next day my aunt came over with my cousin (9M) . He saw my cookie on the table and asked me if he could have it. I told him no and explained to him that I have been wanting the cookie all week. He whined and said “But cookies are my favorite food”. I just said sorry and told him that the next time he comes over we could bake cookies together. He was not satisfied with my answer and ran to my aunt crying. My aunt said to just let him eat it and she will rebuy me the cookie some other time. The thing is. It was sunday and if you know about crumbl they change their menu every week (and pink sugar has not been on the menu in ages!). So this plan was not going to work. I told my aunt this and she said “he is only 9 and you're 16 you can sacrifice a cookie for a small child”. My cousin looked at my aunt again. I once again said no, my aunt just glared at me, turned, looked over at my little cousin and said “go ahead”. My cousin ran over to my cookie. I rush to get it before him but he picks it up first so since he was milliseconds aways from biting the cookie I push the cookie out of his hands and he starts crying. As he is bending down to pick it up off of the floor to still eat it I stomp on it causing it to mush everywhere. My cousin cries so aunt starts to yell at me calling me immature and that I should learn how to sacrifice things for family and children and how giving him the cookie would not have hurt me. She then said “how do you feel now that you are wasting your money from nobody eating it?”. I then told her I would have felt like my money was wasted either way since I bought the cookie for myself and didn't get to eat it.This threw her over the edge and then immediately complained to my dad.

Crumbl Cookies,I bought cookies from five different crumbl locations for “science”,"I was running errands today and realized I was going to be fairly close to five different Crumbl locations. So like the cookie obsessed weirdo that I am, I bought mallow sandwich and skillet cookies at all five so I could see how similar they’d be to one another (and also have plenty to freeze for later). 

I did this before a few years ago, and found huge [variation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrumblCookies/comments/rqmj8r/i_went_to_four_different_crumbl_locations/) from store to store.

This time was a bit more uniform. The skillet cookies were all roughly the same size, weighing between 5.3 and 5.8 oz.  One was strangely grey and much flatter than the rest, with a different color of drizzle. The cookies ranged from just barely baked enough to slightly over baked. One seemed to have milk chocolate chips. The topping was very bland for two and very vanilla forward for one. I’d rate them anywhere from a 2.5 to a 4 out of 5.

Mallow sandwich had a lot of variation in weight: from 7.1 to 9.4 oz. One had filling with no Oreo or brownie - just plain white filling. The filling in that one was also lumpy and tasted off. Two of them had filling that was perfection, lightly sweet with tons of cookie and brownie pieces. One was very similar to whip cream in flavor. I’d rate them between a 0 (tossed the lumpy plain cream ones) and 5 out of 5. 

Moral of the story: bakers are human, there’s lot of variation in these cookies, and if you absolutely hate a cookie everyone loved, it might just be that particular batch at your store. If I’d only ever tried the one lumpy mallow sandwich cookie, I would think y’all were all ridiculous for hyping it so much.

Insomnia Cookies,AIO for being upset with my bf for getting Insomnia Cookies with his friends when I asked for Crumbl?,"Okay I know- the title sounds pretty pathetic haha. Let me provide yall with some context so you know where I’m coming from. 

So, Friday night, I (21F), checked the Crumbl website to see what flavors they had for this week, as I like to do from time to time. I saw that they had a Kit-Kat cookie and I really wanted to try it. I texted my bf (22M) about it since he lives in a town with a Crumbl, less than 10 minutes away from his apartment. I live 2.5 hours away from him now that school has started again, so I’m not able to get it where I’m at. I asked him if he would be willing to get me one and I would Venmo him ahead of time. He said “I should be able to convince the homies to get some cookies.” I said “Yes please let me know, I’ll Venmo you.” That was Friday night. Saturday morning comes around and I open a snap that he sent at around 11 PM on Friday, which I hadn’t opened yet. It was a box of Insomnia Cookies. Not Crumbl cookies. 

To me it seems like a petty move to get Insomnia Cookies rather than the 1 singular cookie I requested, especially since I really don’t ask for much. I don’t ask for things because I’m worried I’ll be disappointed, so I usually just do everything myself. Since the Crumbl flavors change every week though, I figured it’d be no problem for him to run this quick errand for me this one time, especially since his workload is very light. Idk if I’m overreacting or not; it sounds silly to get so worked up over a cookie but there’ve been several red flags popping up since this school year started that have me on edge, so maybe this little incident is just fueling the fire.

Insomnia Cookies,AITA for sticking with my son when my fiancee unfairly punished him?,"I (38) have a son (9) and a stepson (8) from my current fiancee (32).  My fiancee tells me all the time that my son is rude and nasty when I'm not there and acts real bratty when he doesn't get his way but I always give my son a chance to speak his peace. I try to give my son the benefit of the doubt.

Now, my son is a really good kid but doesn't play well with others, especially loud kids who love to tease and make fun. My stepson loves to tease him to the point where he gets angry and takes matters in his own hands  While I've punished him for it, I've also punished his stepbrother for keeping it going and not respecting boundaries, which I think is fair. However, my fiancee always try to paint it like he can dish it but can't take it. I happen to know that he only teases when he gets teased first, mostly because he can't tell if it's an attack or just pure fun. I don't think he really cares which, he just doesn't like it.

Last Saturday (the 12th, not the 19th), I come home from work and I find my son on punishment and when I ask him why, he breaks down and starts crying. I see his stepbrother in the living room playing on the PS5. I asked my fiancee why my son is in his room and she tells me that he was being rude and nasty to all of the kids and adults at am earlier party because he lost a game. 

I sit him down and ask him what happened. He tells me that the whole day, he avoided people who he knew were gonna tease him and make fun of him because he knew that the adults would find it amusing and do nothing about it but if he made fun of someone, my fiancee would be on his ass immediately. The whole time, she was making sure he didn't have too much of the food he liked while she let others gorge themselves and she wouldn't let him play video games while she let her son and others play. Then when they pretty much roped him into playing a board game and he lost first (he claims they cheated, I don't know if they did or not), he left into the other room immediately before they had a chance to tease him for it. He told me that he had no idea if they were going to or not, but he figured if he avoided them and ignored them, they couldn't make fun of him and he wouldn't get in trouble for snapping. He hates that it's ok to make fun and tease him if he lost but if he does it, they flip it like HE does it first. So he pretty much ignored everyone after he lost so he can hide his disappointment and not get in trouble for it. 

After learning this, I told him to get dressed, and I took him out to Sonic's and some Insomnia Cookies to cheer him up and I told him that despite most people considering what he did was rude, I thought he did nothing wrong at all. They were being jerks and I was extremely proud of him for not reacting in the way he has in the past. When we came back home, I found my fiancee packing her things up and taking her son to go stay with her mom for a while. I ask why and she tells me that she can't take living with me and my spoiled brat son anymore, especially if I'm not gonna hold him accountable.

I (38) have a son (9) and a stepson (8) from my current fiancee (32).  My fiancee tells me all the time that my son is rude and nasty when I'm not there and acts real bratty when he doesn't get his way but I always give my son a chance to speak his peace. I try to give my son the benefit of the doubt.

Now, my son is a really good kid but doesn't play well with others, especially loud kids who love to tease and make fun. My stepson loves to tease him to the point where he gets angry and takes matters in his own hands  While I've punished him for it, I've also punished his stepbrother for keeping it going and not respecting boundaries, which I think is fair. However, my fiancee always try to paint it like he can dish it but can't take it. I happen to know that he only teases when he gets teased first, mostly because he can't tell if it's an attack or just pure fun. I don't think he really cares which, he just doesn't like it.

Last Saturday (the 12th, not the 19th), I come home from work and I find my son on punishment and when I ask him why, he breaks down and starts crying. I see his stepbrother in the living room playing on the PS5. I asked my fiancee why my son is in his room and she tells me that he was being rude and nasty to all of the kids and adults at am earlier party because he lost a game. 

I sit him down and ask him what happened. He tells me that the whole day, he avoided people who he knew were gonna tease him and make fun of him because he knew that the adults would find it amusing and do nothing about it but if he made fun of someone, my fiancee would be on his ass immediately. The whole time, she was making sure he didn't have too much of the food he liked while she let others gorge themselves and she wouldn't let him play video games while she let her son and others play. Then when they pretty much roped him into playing a board game and he lost first (he claims they cheated, I don't know if they did or not), he left into the other room immediately before they had a chance to tease him for it. He told me that he had no idea if they were going to or not, but he figured if he avoided them and ignored them, they couldn't make fun of him and he wouldn't get in trouble for snapping. He hates that it's ok to make fun and tease him if he lost but if he does it, they flip it like HE does it first. So he pretty much ignored everyone after he lost so he can hide his disappointment and not get in trouble for it. 

After learning this, I told him to get dressed, and I took him out to Sonic's and some Insomnia Cookies to cheer him up and I told him that despite most people considering what he did was rude, I thought he did nothing wrong at all. They were being jerks and I was extremely proud of him for not reacting in the way he has in the past. When we came back home, I found my fiancee packing her things up and taking her son to go stay with her mom for a while. I ask why and she tells me that she can't take living with me and my spoiled brat son anymore, especially if I'm not gonna hold him accountable. 

It's been a week and my son is very happy, but I may have lost my fiancee. AITA for sticking with my son?

Insomnia Cookies,[DD] The Value Play Cycle Needs Its Third: Why I'm Betting on DNUT,"Alright degenerates, we need to talk. OPEN ripped. KSS followed. But these cycles always come in threes, and we're missing the final piece.

**""History doesn't repeat but it does rhyme""** \- so what's the next verse?

I think it's DNUT. But if you've got a better idea, drop it in the comments. Here's my case:

# The Setup: OPEN your ahole and KSS DNUTz

Yeah, I went there. But while everyone's drunk on the first two gains, there's a $560M market cap company trading at bankruptcy multiples despite growing revenue.

**Current Price: $3.58**  
**Market Cap: $560M**  
**My Target: $8-12**

Show me another 2-3x opportunity this obvious.

# The Valuation Gap Is Insane

Look at these multiples and tell me this makes sense:

|Company|EV/EBITDA|EV/Sales|Context|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**DNUT**|**9.2x**|**1.2x**|Priced for bankruptcy despite growth|
|Starbucks|18.9x|3.57x|Premium coffee valuation|
|Restaurant Brands|17.0x|\~5x|Tim Hortons/BK parent|
|Dunkin' (2020 sale)|**23x**|N/A|What buyers actually pay for donuts|

Yet DNUT is:

* Operating **17,982 points of access globally**
* Posted 5% organic growth in FY2024
* Has one of the most recognized brands in food

Find me another company this disconnected from fundamentals.

# The Bear Cases Are All Weak

**""Ozempic will kill fast food""** \- I'm a fatass myself and there's no amount of Ozempic that removes my craving for hot, fresh donuts at 2am. Look at MCD and CMG at ATHs. People on Ozempic eat less, not never. A glazed donut is 190 calories of pure dopamine - that demand isn't disappearing.

**""The McDonald's deal ended!""** \- No, the TEST ended after rolling out to 2,400 stores. You think McDonald's spent millions on infrastructure for a 3-month trial? They're analyzing data. If it worked (spoiler: donuts + coffee = money), this goes nationwide.

**""They suspended the dividend!""** \- Good. They're investing in growth instead of paying boomers. That's exactly what you want in a turnaround.

# Three Ways This Plays Out

**Starting Point:**

* Stock: $3.58
* Market Cap: $560M
* Growing business with fixable issues

**Scenario 1: Modest Re-rate (12x EBITDA)**

Still way below peers:

* **Target: $8-9**
* **Return: 125-150%**

**Scenario 2: Industry Average (15x)**

If operations improve:

* **Target: $11-13**
* **Return: 200-250%**

**Scenario 3: Nothing Changes (10x)**

Status quo maintained:

* **Target: $5-6**
* **Return: 40-70%**

Even the bear case would be a healthy return on your money. Show me better risk/reward.

# Why The Setup Is Perfect

✓ **Meme-able ticker** (DNUT - come on)  
✓ **Small cap** ($560M = moves fast)  
✓ **Value play** (half peer multiples)  
✓ **Real business** (17,982 locations)  
✓ **Catalyst rich** (McDonald's decision pending)  
✓ **Acquisition target** (at these multiples) ✓ **Options flow confirming** (Huge call buying at $5 strike)

# Recent ""Problems"" Are Actually Bullish

* **Q1 revenue down 1%** → They sold Insomnia Cookies (portfolio cleanup)
* **Dividend suspended** → More cash for growth/turnaround
* **McDonald's test ""ended""** → Infrastructure built, awaiting expansion
* **Debt concerns** → Manageable at 5x EBITDA, becomes nothing if margins improve

Every QSR turnaround story looks exactly like this before the re-rate.

# But Here's Where I Need Your Input

I'm convinced DNUT is the third play because:

1. **Valuation** \- It's the most undervalued name I can find
2. **Size** \- Small enough to move like OPEN and KSS did
3. **Catalysts** \- McDonald's decision, margin improvements, M&A potential
4. **Meme factor** \- The ticker alone guarantees viral potential
5. **Options flow** \- Big money is already positioning

But maybe I'm missing something. What else fits the pattern?

* Under $1B market cap?
* Trading at distressed multiples?
* Has clear catalysts ahead?
* Meme-able enough for WSB?
* Seeing unusual options activity?

Drop your picks below. But until someone shows me better risk/reward than 7:1 upside, I'm loading DNUT.

# Someone's Already Loading - Check the Options Flow

Here's what really got my attention: MASSIVE call buying the past few days, absolutely exploding today. The $5 strikes are getting hammered with volume.

Someone with deep pockets is betting big on a move above $5. That's a 40% move from here, and they're paying premium for it. When smart money moves this aggressively on a small cap, you pay attention.

This isn't retail buying weeklies. This is institutional-sized flow betting on a re-rate.

# The Play

The options market is telling you something. When you see this kind of call buying on a beaten-down small cap with clear catalysts, it usually means someone knows something.

Those $5 calls? If DNUT hits just the LOW end of fair value ($8), those are 10-15x. If it hits $12? Those calls print harder than JPow in 2020.

I like the 11/21 $5 call. IV is only at 87% and volume is sufficient at 2k+

https://preview.redd.it/9lghn7dwqgef1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f654e56abef9da84cf86b0b6c83fa3e7757b2

**My Position:**

The first two already ran. Don't be late to the third.

Because when McDonald's announces the national rollout, when margins tick up even 100bps, when some PE firm offers 15x EBITDA - this thing gaps to $8+ overnight.

Every distressed QSR (finance bro speak for fast food) that fixed itself got bought:

* Dunkin': 23x EBITDA to Inspire Brands
* Panera: Bought by JAB
* Popeyes: Acquired by RBI
* Buffalo Wild Wings: Taken private by Roark

At current multiples, DNUT is a sitting duck.

The cycle comes in threes:  
OPEN ✓  
KSS ✓  
???

I say DNUT. The options flow says DNUT. Prove us wrong.

Edit: position update as of 7/23 12:22am (since I keep getting asked for it). I didn't dump on you. Also, as a warning: DO NOT buy afterhours. That shit is too low volume. Just wait til the morning and get a better price

Insomnia Cookies,Should I have called the police on my dasher?,"Last night I had a sudden craving for something sweet so I ordered cookies and ice cream from Insomnia. 

My dasher, whose name in the app was Elena, delivered my order around 11:57 PM. She took a picture of the order on my porch.

I’m a woman so I always order contactless delivery and wait for my dasher to pull off before grabbing my food. 

Last night, I found it odd that the dasher sent the picture of my order but didn’t drive off. I assumed they were in their car picking another order so I waited patiently for them to drive off. 

After about 4 minutes of them parked in my driveway something began to feel off so I didn’t open the door to get my order.

I thought maybe they were waiting to make sure I got it before leaving but dashers usually don’t do that. So I turned off my porch light to signal that someone is home and will get the order.

Seconds later a hispanic man steps on to my porch for around the corner of my house, steals the order, gets into the car and drives off.

I was terrified. I could not see him from my Ring camera OR from the window in my front door. He was literally hidden out of site. I’m scared to imagine what could have happened if I opened the door.

I reported the dasher to DoorDash’s safety and trust team. I got my tip back and sent DoorDash the ring footage of the man in hopes that him AND Elena be banned from the app for life.

When I was chatting with support they asked me if I called the police. It didn’t occur to me to call them since they were clearly using someone else’s account and they quickly left. I’m still shaken up and probably wont order from the app for a while but should I have called the police?

1/26 UPDATE: Doordash just sent me a push notification saying “We’re Sorry. Take 30% off your next 2 orders of $12+”. That’s bs. I want confirmation that the dasher is banned."

Insomnia Cookies,Protest at Insomnia Cookies,"JOIN US!! 

This demonstration is in response to the inhumane treatment of staff, particularly following (but not limited to) the tragic shooting incident on Monday, October 28, where one of the victims sought refuge in the store. It remains unclear whether a thorough hazmat cleaning has been conducted in the store for the blood after the shooting incident, raising further alarm about reopening which is also allegedly being today and/or tomorrow, thus the sudden cause of the protest today. Corporate is aware that staff within the store attempted their best to clean the blood with towels to the best of their ability while suffering from the traumatic event. Corporate wanted the staff to remain open following the shooting however, store management made the determination to close. Additionally, there are growing concerns among the staff regarding safety, due to an increased incidences of staff being harassed and assaulted by members of the public over the last year. There has been ongoing requests to Insomnia Cookies’ corporation by the store team for a safer work environment without results — the staff feels very uncomfortable and unsafe returning to work and fear retaliation. We have been urging the corporate team to prioritize the well-being of their employees and the community during this critical time yet there has been silence from them, as well as avoidance. There are legal representations being involved now for this matter on behalf of certain employees within the store, as well as OSHA being contacted.

Insomnia Cookies,Do not fall for Krispy Kreme’s IPO trap: A legacy brand with no organic growth that will remain unprofitable,"TL;DR - Short TF out of this or buy puts once available. A company riddled with a history of fraud, misleading investors, and deceitful accounting tactics is being dumped to the public by a large private equity firm.

My god, this is one of the most blatant cash outs I’ve ever seen. CNBC was pumping this name all morning and interviewed their CEO who touted its new “omni-channel” strategy that will lead to better margins. My BS meter started going off so I decided to read their S-1 and see what was going on under the hood.

Krispy Kreme used to be public in the 2000’s and was acquired by JAB Holdings in 2016 for $1.35 billion following numerous scandals of channel stuffing and overstating revenues. Execs would pretty much order shipments of donuts to be sent to franchises and claim sales to meet quarterly estimates. Wild. There are other irregular accounting techniques used throughout the years along with bullying tactics used against franchise owners but you get the picture, won’t go into detail.

So now after a few years of being private sprinkled with an acquisition (Insomnia Cookies), execs/JAB decided it was time to cash out.

In the presentation, Krispy Kreme emphasizes its strong revenue growth. This is a trap. Their organic growth is flat +1% at most when you strip out revenues from their debt heavy acquisition which is why their margins are just awful now and will not improve. It also excludes new shops that were recently opened because it does not matter if you are growing as a company if you can’t achieve economies of scale. You see this a lot with companies who know they can’t be profitable - emphasize revenue growth! 

Krispy Kreme shouldn’t trade at more than 1x its revenue until it proves it can be profitable through some miraculous turnaround. At a $3 billion market cap currently, I forecast it is nearly 40% overvalued. This should be a $10 stock. Whoever the lead underwriter was for this IPO deserves a raise after pulling such a ridiculous multiple. I guess that’s why companies go public when the market is at all-time highs.",5885,669,1625181408.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/obxqrc/do_not_fall_for_krispy_kremes_ipo_trap_a_legacy/,"Do not fall for Krispy Kreme’s IPO trap: A legacy brand with no organic growth that will remain unprofitable TL;DR - Short TF out of this or buy puts once available.

Insomnia Cookies,Rude to me when I'm just trying to help a stranger? RIP your inbox.,"This happened a few years ago, and it still makes me giggle sometimes. 

So, I have a main email that is lastname.firstname at gmail. One day I started getting email that clearly wasn't mine, but also wasn't spam. Think receipts from major stores, etc. Not thinking much of it, I wrote it off as a mistake that would fix itself. It didn't. Within a few months it was several emails a day, which is kind of annoying, but mostly I was concerned that someone was missing a bunch of seemingly important emails, and also it felt really weird and voyeuristic to know so much personal stuff about someone. I know he is a forklift operator who left his job in NC to relocate to Oklahoma, loves junk food and guns, and is partial to porn involving older Black women. It was all a bit unsettling. Finally I got an order confirmation from Insomnia Cookies with his cell phone on it, so I shoot him a text.

""Hey man! I think our emails are getting mixed up, I keep getting things that are clearly intended for you""

""Oh, shit! My email is lastname.firstname at gmail but spelled without the H! Thanks for letting me know""

Great. Crisis averted.

But they kept coming. Newsletters, personal emails, job offers, etc. I forwarded all of them to him diligently since I now knew his email. After a few months of being his personal email secretary, I reached out again.

""Hey! So I'm still getting a lot of emails that are for you. I think maybe you're typing in your email incorrectly...""

He loses his shit. Starts all-caps typing at me about ""why would I do that"" and ""I'm not an idiot"" and ""It's not my fault if people don't know how to spell my name""

I'm not sure how often this guy just hollers his email to people instead of typing it into something, but apparently that's a thing?

So I stopped forwarding his emails. Since they were in my inbox, I figured they must be mine. I unsubbed from everything I got, marked all his personal emails as spam, and cancelled appointments (it's too far for me to drive to Oklahoma to pick up an augur. I don't even need an augur!). I also signed him up for around 100 newsletters like ""winecork fanclub"" and the like, as well as every lame musician and fringe political movement I could think of. I entered his email in every public sign up I could for MONTHS.

Eventually the emails stopped. Hope he finally got that augur.",3571,105,1730218531.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1geyhqg/rude_to_me_when_im_just_trying_to_help_a_stranger/,"Rude to me when I'm just trying to help a stranger?

Insomnia Cookies,I tried 68 different chocolate chip cookies from around the Twin Cities over the past two years.  Here are my rankings.  What are your favorites?,"I tried 68 different chocolate chip cookies from restaurants, stores and bakeries over the past two years.  I initially started with just cookies you could find at a restaurant, and then I expanded it to grocery stores, gas stations, bakeries, and places that are known for their cookies.

Here are my favorites for each category:

* Best overall cookie:  Insomnia Cookies oatmeal walnut chocolate chip
* Best buy-in-bulk cookie:  Costco
* Best fast food cookie:  Chick-fil-A
* Best sandwich chain cookie:  Potbelly
* Best coffee chain cookie:  Scooter's
* Best gas station cookie:  Casey's
* Best MN-only cookie:  Lund's and Byerly's Warm Ooey-Gooey
* Best room-temp (non-warm) cookie:  Mississippi Market
* Most controversial:  Crumbl

Criteria:

1. The cookie was sampled as-served (i.e., eaten warm if served warm).  Many cookies were requested to be served warm, if possible.  Many of the warm cookies would be ranked significantly lower if they were allowed to cool down (they usually become quite hard).
2. The cookie needed to be from a place with multiple locations in the Twin Cities.  This just made it easier for me to limit my locations.
3. The cookie needed to have a traditional chocolate chip base - no double chocolate cookies, gluten free or vegan cookies.  This was also to limit my locations.
4. No limited time flavors.  My original intent was to find a cookie that I could get at any time I wanted a cookie.
5. No pre-packaged ""cookie aisle"" or frozen cookies - only cookies from over-the-counter or bakeries.

My personal flavor preferences:  a thick, warm cookie with semisweet or dark chocolate with a hint of crispiness and a non-bitter aftertaste.  Oatmeal and walnuts are a bonus.  Cookies that have a unique flavor profile, or ones that stand out from the others (e.g., Jimmy John's) are ranked a little higher.

Cookies in higher tiers are ranked higher, though personal preference may depend on the day.  I tend to think of the tiers in this way:

* S:  special occasion cookies
* A:  dessert cookies or for splitting with several people
* B:  a cookie that you might bring in bulk to a party
* C:  if you need a cookie in a pinch, these will work
* F:  don't bother

Notes:

*Sweet Martha's, Doubletree, and HOM Furniture are included mainly for refence.*

*Festival Foods and Knowlan's are owned by the same company and serve the same cookies.*

*Wuollet Bakery and A Baker's Wife serve the same cookie (confirmed by the worker at A Baker's Wife).*

EDIT:  Many of you have recommended a few more places to try:

* Alamo Drafthouse
* Angel Food Bakery
* Angelina's Kitchen
* B'beri Desserts
* Bellecour
* Bread & Chocolate
* Classic Cookie Co.
* Cookie Cart 
* Dave's Downtown
* Dogwood Coffee

Levain Bakery,4 days in NYC from Italy - What I ate (and what I liked),"After months of research and asking for advice here and elsewhere, I finally went (and came back) and can now share my absolutely unrequested and definitely unnecessary four-day trip report with you all.

I tried to be as varied as possible and not limit myself exclusively to Manhattan to get the most complete New York ""Dining Experience."" Of course, you can't do everything in just a few days, and I missed some characteristic New York spots and foods. I'm not making a big deal out of it; in fact, I see it as a good reason to return to the world's food capital as soon as possible.

Note 1: The following list is presented in the order in which I ate things from the first day to the last. To save time and try more things, I sometimes invented meals that don't exist, like lunch at 10:30 in the morning, dinner at 4 in the afternoon, and a second dinner at 8, plus numerous snacks.

Note 2: Maintaining this eating schedule was not easy. In addition to inventing meals, I also had to invent bathroom breaks (sometimes creatively, like inside shopping malls or on the Summit). I was able to confirm the plentiful presence and excellent cleanliness of public restrooms in New York. This is not a given for a city with over 8 million inhabitants.

But enough talk, let's get to the list:

Scarr’s Pizza
Hot Boi slice: Good, maybe a bit too spicy for my taste, so much so that I didn't want to eat more than one slice. 7.5

Calabria Pork Store
Soppressata e provala sandwich: As an Italian, I appreciated it. It was like eating a sandwich at home—good quality bread, excellent salami and cheese. It's still just a sandwich (and maybe it seems trivial to me), but it's a good sandwich. 7.5

Mei Lai Wah
Pineapple roast pork bun: Good. I had heard mixed opinions on the flavor and how heavy it was, but it actually seemed like a good compromise between different flavors, and I would have gladly eaten more than one. 8

Ming Wong
Tri-meat over rice (duck, pork, chicken): As a regular consumer of rice with various types of meat, I found it just sufficient. The meat glaze raises the level a bit, but I wouldn't try it again. 6.5

Tao Hong
Egg tart: This was my first egg tart; I had never eaten one, so I can't compare it to others. It was good, but maybe a bit too heavy. 7

Katz’s
Pastrami on rye: What can I say? Excellent pastrami and a great dining experience. It's the only tourist trap that is anything but a trap. 9

Levain Bakery
Rocky Road: I got it on one of the last days you could get it and took the opportunity. An excellent cookie that wasn't too hard on the outside or too soft on the inside. 7.5

William Greenberg
 B/W cookie: An unexpected texture and flavor. It almost seems like a cake. Very good. 8

Soothr
Hat Yai chicken: I expected it to be spicier or have a more particular flavor, different from typical fried chicken, but it was good overall. 7

Panang Duck Lychee Curry: The curry was excessively spicy, so much so that it couldn't be eaten alone (or with the rice that comes with it). But the caramelized duck somehow canceled out the effect, and you could eat it without a problem, and it was even good. It was definitely a new flavor for me. 8.5

Minetta Tavern
Black Label Burger: Not the best burger of my life, as many people say, but it's definitely at the top of the list. I'd give the food an 8, but if we also talk about the atmosphere and service, then it’s hands down my favorite restaurant among all the ones I tried. 9.5

Librae Bakery
Pistachio rose croissant: I didn't like the first bites, but then I started to appreciate the flavor. The pistachio filling was very good and plentiful, which somehow justifies the price of over nine dollars, but after a while, it feels heavy; you almost feel like you can't finish it. The size is a whole meal; I think I was full for a long time after eating it. 7.5

Tompkins Square Bagel
Lox and cream cheese with onions: As a European, I'm not a big consumer of bacon. I had only eaten one other bagel with the same toppings, at another place in New York State (CBT in Ithaca). This was my first bagel in NYC, and I got the same one as a comparison. I liked it; it was fresh and very well-filled. Again, I don't have a bagel culture, so I don't think it will ever become my favorite food, but it's a good dish. 7.5

Los Tacos No. 1
Adobada corn tacos: Excellent meat, spiced just right, great toppings, and the tortilla texture was perfect. Despite the ingredients, it's very light, and I could potentially have eaten many more without feeling the consequences. 8.5

L’Industrie
Fig jam and bacon and spicy salami: In Italy, I'm used to a very specific style of pizza—not Neapolitan, but what we call ""contemporary,"" with a light, low, and thin crust that holds up when you pick it up. In some ways, this pizza reminded me of that. Very good, especially the fig jam and bacon. 8.5

Mama’s Too
Angry Nonna: I'm not usually a big fan of square pizzas and I'm sticking with that idea, but in this case, I liked it. Even though I was full and didn't feel like eating anymore, I ate it down to the last bite. 7.5

7th Street Burger
Cheeseburger: It's still a fast-food joint, but of the ones I tried, it's definitely the best. The prices are fair for the size, the meat melts in your mouth, and the bun is good too. 7.5

Culture Espresso
Chocolate chips cookie: If they call it the best cookie in New York, there's a reason, and I agree. It's quite crunchy on top but extremely filled and very soft on the bottom. As soon as you break it in half, a flood of chocolate comes out. 8

Los Mariscos
Shrimp tacos: The same considerations as for Los Tacos No. 1 apply here. An excellent taco, good shrimp, and a price that fits the size. 8.5

Jamrock Jerk
Boneless pork: This was my first approach to Jamaican/Caribbean cuisine, and I liked it. The smokiness and spices of the meat were excellent, and the portions were very generous. 7.5

The Original Chinatown Ice Cream Factory
Chocolate chips ice cream: I'm not a big fan of ice cream, or at least not the creative flavors, so I went with a safe bet. It was a good ice cream with a very generous portion. 7


The following were NOT photographed:

Breads Bakery
Babka: Excellent, perhaps one of the best desserts I ate in the city. It stays soft and good even days later. I bought another one to take home. 9
B/W cookie: Good but nothing special. 6.5

L&B Spumoni
Sicilian square: I appreciated the consistency of the crust, but I really didn't like the toppings. 6

Smashed at Time Out Market
Classic smash: A normal burger, neither great nor terrible. A good, no-frills smash, nothing special. 6.5

Tao Hong
Lotus Mooncake: I had another Mooncake in Milan's Chinatown and didn't like it. In this case, I can confirm that I still didn't appreciate the taste, even though I considered it a much better product than the one I had already eaten. It's probably just not a dessert suited to my palate. NC (No score given)

Banh Mi Co Ut
Vietnamese iced coffee: I liked the taste and texture. It's not very different from other similar products; you don't really feel the uniqueness of it being a Vietnamese recipe. For what it costs ($5), it's a small amount and finishes quickly. I wouldn't get it again, but overall, it wasn't bad. 6.5

Bar Pisellino
Espresso: A perfectly made coffee just like the ones I have in Italy. I looked for and drank several espressos during my stay, but this one was definitely the best. It made me feel like I was back home. 9",2393,232,1757449746.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ncu654,"4 days in NYC from Italy - What I ate (and what I liked) After months of research and asking for advice here and elsewhere, I finally went (and came back) and can now share my absolutely unrequested and definitely unnecessary four-day trip report with you all.

Levain Bakery,levain bakery,"tl;dr - after two not so good visits, third time was indeed the charm and both items were amazing. lives up to the hype (ish ?). 

beef cheek, jalapeño and cheese pie was $10.50 (low key the best pie to ever exist) and their raspberry lamington ($6.90). so i know this place is legendary, however, the first two times I went, this same pie was a bit of a let down. both times the beef was over cooked and chewy. the jalapño chunks were nice and thicc but not many in there. lamington has been consistently unreal every time tho, slightly on the firmer side but in the best way. that jam is also delicious and there's a healthy dollop of it.  good size too, bigger than it looks in the photo.

the pie this time was so damn good too ! easily the best jalapeño, cheese and steak I've had. the kind of pie i think about for days later. pastry had substance to it but not too thick, top layer of pastry was nice and flaky, and the beef cheek was cooked to perfection, just broke away so easily. this time the jalapeños were also packed which i love to see. a healthy amount of cheese too with a nice cheddary flavour. 

unfortunate it took three tries but well worth two not so great experiences. ",105,40,1754206268.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgd9a1,"levain bakery tl;dr - after two not so good visits, third time was indeed the charm and both items were amazing. lives up to the hype (ish ?).

the pie this time was so damn good too ! easily the best jalapeño, cheese and steak I've had. the kind of pie i think about for days later. pastry had substance to it but not too thick, top layer of pastry was nice and flaky, and the beef cheek was cooked to perfection, just broke away so easily. this time the jalapeños were also packed which i love to see. a healthy amount of cheese too with a nice cheddary flavour. 

unfortunate it took three tries but well worth two not so great experiences. "

Levain Bakery,Copycat Levain Bakery Autumn cookies,"Levain Bakery’s Autumn Cookie is the oversized autumn jumper of biscuits 🍪🍂 — and being an autumn girl, I had to bake my own.

Think: giant, gooey cookies loaded with dark chocolate chunks, molasses, cinnamon, ginger & nutmeg. Basically autumn in every bite.

Here’s what I used: 

	•	140g unsalted butter (cold)
	•	130g light/dark brown sugar
	•	80g caster sugar
	•	2 eggs
	•     1 tsp vanilla bean paste (optional)
	•	40g molasses/black treacle
	•	350g plain flour
	•	1 tsp baking powder
	•	½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
	•	2 tsp cornflour
	•	Pinch of salt
	•	2 tsp ground cinnamon
	•	½ tsp ground nutmeg
	•	1 tsp ground ginger
	•	200g dark chocolate chips/chunks
	•	100g cinnamon chips (optional)

Method
	1.	Beat butter + sugars until fluffy.
	2.	Add eggs, vanilla, molasses.
	3.	Mix flour, baking powder, bicarb, cornflour, salt + spices.
	4.	Combine wet + dry, then stir in chocolate.
	5.	Chill dough overnight (the secret to thick, bakery-style cookies 👀).
	6.	Scoop out large dough balls onto a lined tray.
	7.	Bake at 180°C for 12-14m- fridge temperatures vary , once the edges are looking golden and crispy, that’s your sign! 

	8.	Cool slightly, then enjoy that gooey centre! 🤤

Levain Bakery,Levain Bakery NoHo Location: Honest Cookie Review,"So after a day at work, I decided I needed something ultra comforting and settled on their signature cookie assortment. Levain is know for their large 6 ounces cookies which have become quite popular on social media. 

So my first impression was wow! They were huge mounds of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It’s not easy to make cookies this thick without them being a bit raw in the middle, but they nailed it. Their signature cookie assortment come with one of each of four cookie flavors: chocolate chip walnut, dark chocolate chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and dark chocolate peanut butter chip. 

Obviously, I went straight for the oatmeal raisin and was surprised and sorta disappointed at the same time. It was good, only it wasn’t what you’d think an oatmeal raisin cookie would taste like!.. Actually, it’s nothing like your typical oatmeal raisin cookies which I was a little bummed out about. It was just like a regular cookie full of raisins in it. Has no hint of cinnamon or nutmeg cozy traditional oatmeal raisin cookie flavor. Ok, that’s weird. 

I took nibbles from the remaining three and found the chocolate peanut butter chip cookies to be my least favorite. All four cookies were loaded with chocolate chips, raisins, walnuts, etc. They certainly did not skimp on the ingredients. What I did like about them was that they weren’t overly sweet!

Levain Bakery,Suggestions to alter levain percents to meet schedule of bagel bakery,"Hi friends! I'm starting a small sourdough bagel bakery based on success with my bagel recipe. However, my current recipe is presenting challenges regarding scheduling. I am sharing a kitchen space and need to be out by 1230pm. I prepare my dough at 4am.

I'd prefer not to take my sourdough home every day and lug the levain back.

SO - my question to you is how you would approach this? Initial thoughts were to lower hydration to maybe 45% but that makes mixing difficult (but possible if its the only way to make this work). Other options would be then to lower innoculation...but at what percent?

Levain Bakery,The truth about “naturally thin” people,"Hello all! I kinda just wanted to share my thoughts and experiences with the mythical “naturally thin” person, with new insight due to my recent weight loss. 

So I used to be like most people who struggle to lose weight and thought that thin people were just genetically blessed with super fast metabolisms. They always seemed to be eating whatever they want and staying in shape. Considering my mother is one of these people, it truly beats me how I didn’t realize what actually was going on for so long. 

If you catch her on vacation, you’d be shocked - a recent weekend in Boston had her at levain every bakery every morning, eating pastries without a second thought, followed by a mocha from Starbucks, several other meals, and dessert (or multiple). 

How can she do this and stay so thin? Vacation is about the only time she will ever eat like this. At home, she has coffee in the morning, and barely anything else until dinner. She will snack on protein bars only when hunger gets unavoidable and distracting. She’ll make toast, then leave it in the toaster because she forgot about it. She is very open about the fact that she doesn’t even try - she just forgets to eat and would rather focus on other tasks. Even after a long day of barely eating, she will come home and do about 10 other chores, usually not eating until about 9. 

My best friend is the same way. She doesn’t diet or exercise religiously. She just is not distracted by hunger or food noise. 

So, in short? Naturally thin people are genetically blessed in a way- just not with metabolism. I’m now convinced they simply do not focus on/feel hunger as much as those who struggle with weight. This puts their overall caloric intake low, and hence why in social settings/on vacation/ at events, they indulge carelessly, because it is the only time they are actually focused on food and eating. 

Where does this leave the rest of us, who haven’t yet evolved out of starving caveman mentality?

Personally, while I will never be able to go a full day barely eating, it has taught me the importance of mindfulness and allowing yourself to actually feel hunger before eating. Furthermore, I now view most of my meals are nutrition and fuel, saving those indulgences for special occasions. 

I can’t give up the joy of social eating. Makes discipline the rest of the week/month/year worth it!

Levain Bakery,Thank You Denver!,"I don’t usually comment or post on Reddit, but after lurking on the sub here I wanted to show some appreciation for the best bites we had on our visit. My boyfriend and I both work in the food industry in NYC and try to get out of the city before summer starts, and we always plan our visits around food. Denver did not disappoint!

Our favorite spots were Alma Fonda Fina, Annette Scratch to Table, Hop Alley, Bakery Four, and Pit Fiend. We always like to try places with a good bar program and good baked goods since he is a bar manager and I am a pastry chef. We went to maybe a dozen places that we’ve seen mentioned here, but the ones above would easily be a top option in LA or NYC (we moved from LA to NY during covid). 

Hop Alley had amazing drinks and a great vibe with the music and lighting. The La Zi Ji wasn’t one of our favorite dishes, but it’s the only one I got a decent picture of because we ate everything else too quick!

Annette Scratch to table was one our favorites, and reminded us most of home cooking. Everything was subtle but well executed and the pate was easily a top 3 bite of the trip.

Alma Fonda Fina was incredible. Loved how casual it was and every bite was excellent, but the tostada was chefs kiss! I’d go to a place like this all the time if I lived here and the reservations weren’t so hard to come by.

Bakery Four was indescribable. We read about the lines, but we wait for everything back home and it wasn’t bad at all for a Saturday. Everything was perfect and being a pastry chef I can say confidently that this may be my favorite bakery in the country just ahead of Radio (which I have a soft spot for it though because I worked there for a bit).

Pit Fiend! We’re not really bbq people, and never lived in a place where it was a top option but everything was so good and smoked wonderfully!

Some places we liked but didn’t necessarily love were Levain Deli, Little Man Ice Cream, and Cart-Driver Pizza (the drinks and apps we had were exceptional though). It’s not that they were bad or anything, but nothing blew us away.

Some places we weren’t fans of at all were:

Rosenbergs bagels, we read on here that it wasn’t good, but it was near our Airbnb and my boyfriend felt like we had to at least try it. We eat bagels a lot, and this just wasn’t it.

Getrights we had high hopes for, but everything was so sweet and over the top we just couldn’t really even finish anything.

Fire on the mountain we stopped for a quick lunch and thought it was a little too kitschy, but some of the sauces were good. 

There’s so many places we wanted to try like sap sua, king of wings, makfam, poulette, white pie, little Arthurs, beckon, and right cream just to name a few. Some of them the reservations are crazy far out, but we hope to be back. Thank you again for the hospitality and you all are lucky to have so many wonderful places!

Levain Bakery,Must try eats in NYC/Unique American foods,"Hi all, I'm visiting NYC for the first time from Australia. I'm only there for 4.5 days and would like to try everything that's unique to NYC/USA. So far this is on my want to go list:

* **Pastrami sandwich** \- Katz deli, Sarge's deli
* **Halal food** \- Halal guys, Adele's
* **Hotdog** \- Gray's Papaya
* **Soul food** \- Charles pan fried chicken, Pies & Thighs. **Never had soul food before, so keen to hear other recommendations.**
* **Tacos** \- Los Tacos no.1
* **Steakhouse** \- Peter Luger's (haven't decided if I should go, since I'm travelling alone, can't order much food)
* **Pizza** \- Prince St Pizza, Joe's, L’industrie Pizzeria, Mama's Too, Bleeker St Pizza
* **Burger** \- Shake Shack, Five Guys, Hamburger America.
* **Bakeries** \- Lafayette Grand Café & Bakery,
* **Pancakes** \- Clinton St Bakery
* **Bagels** \- Apollo Bagels, Ess-a, Russ & Daughters, Liberty bagels.
* **Cheesecake** \- Eileen's, Cheesecake factory, Juniors, Magnolia's
* Any American bbq, diner, bodega/deli/chop cheese recommendations?

I heard Bacon Egg Cheese is quite a NY thing, is there anything else you recommend that I try that's unique to NY or the US.

Edit: Thank you all for the suggestions, I've been reading each and every comment below. I wasn't expecting this much feedback but I grateful for it. Seems like the general consensus is Peter Luger's and Halal Guy's (and probably most of the popular restaurants on social media) are not worth trying and there's better options out there. Also NY isn't a BBQ place and I should try more Puerto Rican or Dominican cuisine. Now I have the difficult decision to decide what to take off my list and what to add on.

Levain Bakery,Our trip to NYC,"Thank you all for an amazing time! 
Visited Manhattan for a week with the missus and had a blast! 
We were a bit apprehensive after reading about rising crime rates and shootings and Covid but the city was absolutely gorgeous and amazing. 

Everybody was extremely nice, the subway was great and efficient and I’ve never been in a place where everybody is aware of each other but at the same time doing everything they can to avoid eye contact with another human and the homeless weren’t too aggressive. 
Your roads are terrible though. 
what 
We visited The Met, The Rubin, Central Park, The Treasures Exhibition at the NYPL which was mind blowing. We walked all over the city including the upper east side, lower east side, the village, Financial District, soho, noho, crossed over to Brooklyn and more. 

We tried to eat at every famous pizza place without dying. 

1st Place: Pizza Suprema
2nd Place: Juliana’s
3rd Place: Joe’s Pizza
5th Place: Patsy’s Pizza
6th Place:  Lombardi’s
7th Place: John of Bleeckers St. 
8th Place: Prince Street Pizza. This was pretty boring. Like your normal DiGiorno pie from Walmart. 

For the next trip we want to try Scarrs and Grimaldi’s. 
Another pizza place we tried was Emmets deep dish. It was…okay. Nothing more, nothing less. 
I’ll add that the service in all of the mentioned establishments was extremely good and everybody was so attentive and nice. The ranking is based solely on the food. 

To satisfy our sweet tooth we tried Mia’s Brooklyn bakery, Molly’s Cupcakes, Maman, Levain, Balthazar, Mah-Ze-Dahr and Milk Bar, Ample Hills Creamery and Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. 

Mia’s Brookyln Bakery- Tried the Vanilla Bean & Strawberry shortcake. Nice cake. Good frosting but nothing to write home about. 

Molly’s Cupcakes- Tried a few cupcakes there. Felt very homemade in a way that I can’t explain but all in all, not bad. Cake Batter cupcake was the best of the batch.

Maman- Extremely good chocolate chip cookie. 

Levain Bakery- Heaven. Especially their new 2 chip cookie. 

Balthazar- The scones were amazing. Simply amazing. The sandwiches were good and their chocolate chip cookie was simply disappointing. 

Mah Ze Dahr- Their cookie was also pretty simple. The true star of the show was the delicious Devil in Ganache cake. Not too sweet, not too rich. It was really, really good. 

Milk Bar- The crack pie was really good and so was the birthday cake. Simple perfection. 

Chinatown Ice Cream Factory was really good if you don’t mind trying out exotic flavors like Taro. Wouldn’t go there for your run of the mill flavors like cookies and cream. 

Ample Hills Creamery is just that. The ice cream is wonderfully creamy and the portions are big. The flavors are wonderful and rich. 

We also tried the Frozen Hot Chocolate at Serendipity 3 which tasted like a Ben & Jerry’s chocolate milk shake. We couldn’t understand what the hype was all about. The place itself looks awesome though. 

And lastly in the sweet tooth section, we  also managed to eat at Veniero’s which needs no introduction or any critique. 

For breakfast we stopped by Absolute Bagels and also Best Bagels. 
For me, Absolute Bagels was the winner. 
The content of the bagel, the cream cheese and the bagel itself were amazing. 
For a breakfast without bagels, we went to Clinton St. Baking Company which was one of the best places we ate in during the trip. The pancakes were fucktastic, the place was cozy and the service was impeccable. 10/10. 
 
For lunch we tried out Xi’an Famous Food which was the best Chinese food we had outside of China. The flavors took us back to China. Be wary of the spiciness of the food! I ordered mildly spicy and nearly had to call 911. 

On another day, we ate at Ippundo NY which had amazing Ramen and really good buns. The pork and chicken were perfect.  

Anyways, thanks again NYC. Can’t wait to come back! We enjoyed every second.

Levain Bakery,60 hours in NYC,"Hi! I’m from Montreal and me and my wife love NY! We have gone a few times and normally we fly but this time we decided to drive, we love eating and walking so here our adventure!

Since there are too many places, feel free to ask questions on the comments, I’ll be answering all of them. I won’t be able to post photos of all or to comment too much on each, to not make this post longer than it will inevitably be.

**Day 1**

We left Montreal at around 10am on Sunday, it is a 6 and a half our drive, so our first stop was after a 3 hours driving for gas and:

- Starbucks + KFC. (Great fries, and KFC is a million times better in USA than in Canada)

We checked in to our hotel close to Times Square and started our food tour! All of it was walking, no metro, bus, taxi, etc.

- Zeppola (Just for a pistachio croissant that we shared)

Tried my luck with 4 Charles which I had tried Rsv from a month before through 2 Cc concierges and resy without success, still no luck getting in. 

- Starbucks Reserve (Had the flight of martinis, really loved the different flavors)

- L’Industrie (Great pizza, we had the whole pie to share) [Photo 1]

- Magnolia Bakery (the OG to try their Oreo Banana Pudding.

**Day 2**

- Culture Espresso (Still my fav cookie in NY)
- Cafe Leone
- Sunday Morning (Amazing cinnamon rolls!)
- King of Cannoli (4 mini-cannolis to go, the best was the og)
- Golden Diner - 3 hour waitlist and it was an actual 3 hour wait. The pancakes and wings were amazing but wouldn’t wait again for 3 hours.
- Matcha 108 (While waiting, great matcha!) [Photo 2]
- La Mercerie (1 cookie to share, while waiting)
- Peter Pan - By the time we arrived they didn’t have a lot of variety but they gave us a pastry for free since they didn’t take card and we had no cash, very nice lady!
- La Gnoccheria ( Amazing fried gnocchi with truffle) [Photo 3]
- Anita Gelato - to walk back to the hotel [Photo 4]

**Day 3**

- Popup Bagels (I found the salt bagel way too salty, but the everything was amazing) [Photo 5]

After a 10k run in Central Park

- Arabica %
- Glace foodtruck (Shared that funny face cookie with ice cream)
- 7th Street Burger (My first smash burger ever and I loved it)
- mini Reese’s cup to share
- Krispy Kreme (Trying the Harry Potter donuts, I loved the Revenclaw one! Nothing like a good classic American donut) [Photo 6]
- Nathan’s Cart (Loaded fries were great)
- Adele’s Famous (Still amazing food and the line wasn’t terrible)
- Junior’s Cheesecake (Plain and Oreo, I liked both, but I if I had to choose it would be Oreo)

**Day 4**

- Gumption Coffee
- Los tacos No.1 food cart (“the Donkey”) [Photo 7] 
- I’m Donut ? (Great donuts with a twist!)

Checked out from the hotel at noon and on our way driving off the city picked up:

- Levain (Second favorite cookie in NY, it’s also massive) [Photo 8]
- Mama’s Too [Photo 9]

Will be back soon to try more new places and return to my favs!
